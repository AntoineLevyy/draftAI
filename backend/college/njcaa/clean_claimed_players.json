We played in the Surf Cup, the Super Cup NI (formerly known as the Milk Cup), and I was selected as one of the top 10 players to travel to Germany to play in the FC Bayern Youth Cup which was played at the Allianz. At 16 I made the switch to St. Catharine’s Roma Wolves in League 1 Ontario which is the Semi-Pro league in Ontario, Canada. I was a regular starter contributing 90 minutes consistently as the youngest player in the league at the age of 16. I played here for a few season prior to going off to college. Throughout my high school years I had the privilege of trialing with numerous clubs in Italy (Viterbese, Gubbio, Chievo, and numerous other 4th division clubs) but unfortunately I wasn’t able to sign because I didn’t have my EU paperwork and I wasn’t old enough for a work visa. I finally received my Italian Citizenship last year and hope to play professional post graduation.",

    "Soccer Background":"I grew up in Trinidad, at the young age of 12 I joined my first club “Police FC” where I learned the basics and was challenged to enhance my already God given talent. I played with Police FC from the age of 12 to 21 years old where I played at the youth level. I started training with the senior team at 16 years old but never made my senior debut or signed any contracts because I always dreamt of playing at the top level of college. At the high school level, I played for Tunapuna Secondary then went to Arima North Secondary where I won the SSFL East Zone Title and was named a SSFL All Star. I was named an All Star Twice, winning two titles and being named top scorer in my high school career. These accomplishments and performances helped me to get two stints with the National Under 17 & 20 teams. \n\nPolice FC – (2012 – 2023):\nYouth Tier One League – 2012 – 2023\nYouth Tier One League 2nd Place Finish 2018\nBridge The Gap Top Youth League Winner 2023\n \nSecondary Schools Football League (SSFL):\nMen’s SSFL Championship East Zone Title 2019\nMen’s SSFL All Star 2019\nMen’s SSFL Big 5 Playoff Competition – 4th Place (2019)\nMen’s SSFL All Star 2018\nUnder 18 East Zone League Winner 2018\nUnder 18 East Zone League Golden Boot 2018\n \nNational Team:\nFinal 35 Squad At Under 17 Level (2018) And Under 20 (2020)\n                (Missed out due to things beyond my control at the time)\n\nMost recently had talk with Halifax Wanderers In Canada and currently in talks to play USL2 in the summer with FC Indiana",
